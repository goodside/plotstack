## PlotStack

**PlotStack** is a tool to more easily create basic Matplotlib subplots, with an
API the prioritizes convenience for interactive use in Jupyter notebooks.
Speicfically, it eliminates the need to specify the sizes, positions, or even
the number of subplots in advance of creating them, and creates figures that
expand vertically as needed to fit their content.
